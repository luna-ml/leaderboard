## Add new challenges

Please create a pull request with a new project directory to add a new challenge. You'll need to provide evaluation environment and scoring function.

See [Quickstart](https://luna-ml.github.io/luna/quickstart/index.html) guide to learn more about how to create a new Luna ML Project.

## Submit a model

Please create a pull request with a new model under each project directory.

Once merged, your model will be automatically evaluated, scored and displayed on the leaderboard.

See [Quickstart](https://luna-ml.github.io/luna/quickstart/index.html) guide to learn more about how to submit a model.
